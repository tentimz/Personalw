Why is attention to detail important for Salesforce Admins?
Proofreading and design work
This is all about being consistent in your writing style, using correct language and grammar, and fact-checking your work. Practicing attention to detail is relevant for not only the Salesforce org you maintain but also your daily communication, like chats, emails, and presentations. Nothing is as frustrating as going into a Salesforce org and finding spelling mistakes in help text or inconsistencies in capitalization.

Time management
This is about managing your workday to ensure you have sufficient time to complete tasks without making mistakes. Good planning is important. As an admin, you’re involved in all kinds of plans and deadlines. Knowing how much time you have, how long tasks take, and where you’re dependent on others is important for a good plan.

Within time management you also focus on meeting participation and structure. If you have 15 minutes to demo the latest features for your org, then make sure you can do it within that window. Being able to deliver good content on time is important.

Organization
How do you structure not only your workspace but also your mind? Reducing visual distractions so you can focus on the tasks at hand is probably the easiest part. However, structuring your tasks by complexity and urgency is a bigger challenge. Knowing what needs to be done by when and not feeling overwhelmed requires dedication and focus. We all occasionally experience the last-minute rush to finalize a project or meet a deadline. But in not giving yourself sufficient time, errors can—and most likely will—happen.
