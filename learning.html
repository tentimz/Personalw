                            In programming, object-oriented means that the code focuses on describing objects, which have unique characteristics. Examples include people, accounts, or flowers.

                            A class is a blueprint for objects, defining shared characteristics (variables) and behaviors (methods) of all objects of that class. For example, a flower class might include variables like color and height, and methods like grow and wilt.
                        </ul>

                            Methods represent behaviors or actions for objects of a class. For example, a flower class might have methods such as grow, pollinate, or wilt.

                        </ul>

                            Parameters are variables that serve as placeholders in methods, allowing different values to be passed into the method. For example, a parameter like numberOfPetals in the wilt method receives a value to operate on.

                            Methods may return a value or not. The return type specifies what kind of value the method will return (e.g., integer, string) or can be void, meaning it returns nothing. For example, the wilt method may return an integer representing the number of petals left after wilting.

                        </ul>

                            Objects are instances of a class, inheriting its variables and methods. For example, a tulip object is an instance of the flower class, inheriting variables like color and height and methods like grow and wilt.

                            To create an object, you instantiate a class. For example, Flower tulip = new Flower(); creates a tulip object from the Flower class. Dot notation is used to call methods on objects (e.g., tulip.grow();).

    <h1> Introduction to sObjects and DML in Salesforce Apex   </h1>
    <div class="def">
        In Salesforce development, sObjects and Data Manipulation Language (DML) are crucial for managing and interacting with data.
         Here's a quick overview to get you started:<br><br>

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2> <br>
 
        <ol><li>
            <strong> What is an sObject? </strong>
            <p> An sObject is an Apex data type that represents a Salesforce object, like an Account, Contact, or Opportunity. <br> 
                Unlike most data types that hold single values, sObjects are containers that can hold multiple fields and values related to a Salesforce record. For example, an Account sObject can store attributes like Name, Phone, and AccountNumber.<br>
            </p>
        </li></ol> 
        <br>
        <ol><li><strong>DML Basics</strong><br>
            <p> Data Manipulation Language (DML) in Apex lets you insert, update, and delete records in Salesforce through code, similar to how you might use tools like Data Loader for bulk uploads.<br>
                DML commands include Insert, Update, and Delete to perform actions directly on sObject records.
                <br>
            </p>
        </li></ol>           
<br>
<h2>Creating and Managing Records with sObjects and DML</h2> <br>

<strong>Setting Field Values:</strong> Use dot notation to assign values to sObject fields, e.g., Account myAcct = new Account(); myAcct.Name = 'The Tea Factory';.<br>

<strong>Inserting Records:</strong> To add records to the Salesforce database, declare a new sObject and use the Insert DML command:<br><br>
        <pre class="example"><code>
            public class NewAccounts {
                public static void sObjectsInsert(){
                    Account store = new Account();
                    store.Name = 'The Tea Factory';
                    insert store;
                }
            }
            
        </code></pre>
<h2>Bulk Record Insertion with Loops</h2> <br>
<strong>Using Lists and Loops: To add multiple records, leverage lists and a loop structure :<br></strong>
<br>
        <pre class="example"><code>
            public class NewAccounts {
                public static void sObjectsInsert(Integer count){
                    List<Account> teaFactoryAccounts = new List<Account>();
                    for(Integer i = 1; i <= count; i++){
                        Account store = new Account(Name = 'The Tea Factory ' + i, AccountNumber = '35629' + i);
                        teaFactoryAccounts.add(store);
                    }
                    insert teaFactoryAccounts;
                }
            }
            
        </code></pre>
        <br>
        <p>Running this method with count = 3 creates three Account records.  </p> <br>
<h2>Best Practice: Bulkification </h2> <br>
<strong>Why Bulkify?</strong><br>
<p>Inserting multiple records at once is efficient and crucial for scalability.<br>
     Instead of inserting records individually, adding them as a batch helps stay within Salesforce's governor limits, which cap insert operations per transaction.<br>
     Bulkification helps your application scale by performing mass insertions within limited resources.</p><br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    This introduction to sObjects and DML in Salesforce sets a foundation for working with Salesforce data through code, making your applications scalable and efficient. <br>
