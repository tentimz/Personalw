      <td>Tennis club App using Salesforce <br></td> 
      <td><br></td> 

      The road to developing an app for the Asca Tennis Club was mostly defined by my prior experiences at the club. Each time I visited to play tennis, I ended up confronting the same problem: coaches and players using the court I had previously reserved for a session with my coach. Other coaches didn't just come there; often, we had to either change courts or pack together in one court, thus making it an unpleasant experience for all involved.

      On the flip side, it was also hard for me, as a member, to communicate with other players in the club. <br>
      I just didn't have access to their contact details, making it difficult to set up matches or reach out to them.<br>
      No memberâ€™s communication platform for broadcasting their messages to peers or communicating with coaches existed.<br>
      This lack of interconnectedness made it very hard for members to develop a sense of community.<br>
      After learning Salesforce, gaining expertise in Apex, and obtaining my Salesforce Developer certification, I realized I had the tools to solve these problems.<br>
      The idea for the app was born from the need to streamline court reservations, connect members, and provide a smoother experience for everyone. <br>
      The Asca Tennis Club app became my way to bring my technical skills and passion for problem-solving together, creating a solution to challenges I had experienced firsthand as a club member.<br>
